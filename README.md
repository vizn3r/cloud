# Cloud storage thingy (WIP - no official releases yet)

*I just really wanted my own cloud storage thingy xd*

## The core idea:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vizn3r/cloud/refs/heads/main/documentation/server-client.png">

### Client 1
*basic, vanilla, classic cloud storage*

- Basic cloud storage, as any other cloud storage (OneDrive, Google Drive, DropBox...)
- Upload/Download/Delete files on/from the cloud storage

### Client 4
*share files, upload from external services*

- Uploader capabilities
- Share files publicly, securely, temporary/pernament
- Support uploaders (like ShareX)
- Embeds for Discord/Twitter(X)/Facebook...

### Client 2 + 3
*this concept might already exist, but I wanna make it myself*

- Share files without the need of uploading them to the server
- Direct, P2P file transfer
- Server is only the orchestrator of the P2P connection
- Only limitation is that both Clients have to be online

## Client apps

### Web client app
*again, vanilla stuff*

- Classic cloud storage web interface

### Desktop app/CLI
*for the P2P file access*

- Will make the P2P possible
- Take advantage of web-to-app architecture
